# Parsnip

A small Argparser

# Features

* **Autogenerated help/version commands**
  - can be overwritten
  - <program> [subcommand]* help & <program> [subcommand]* version commands are also generated
  - name/version/about parameters default to using Cargo.toml CARGO_PKG_NAME/CARGO_PKG_VERSION/CARGO_PKG_DESCRIPTION variables
* **Arguments**
  - supports short `-h` and `--help` syntax
  - unicode support by default
  - **Flags**
    - supports combinations (e.g `-rli` is the same as `-r -l -i`)
    - supports repeats, e.g `-vvv -v` will count as the same flag `v` appearing 4 times
  - **With Values**
    - supports constraints on the number of values for an arg, e.g having exactly one value, having between 2 & 4 values, having any number of values. E.g `-v foo bar`
    - supports restricting values to specific *primitive* types (any, bool, i32, i64, f32, f64, String) via the TryInto trait
    - supports additional custom validation (so you can e.g write your own sum type restrictions)
    - supports default values
  - **Combinations**
    - Parsing can be configured to fail if any required argument is missing
    - supports requiring at least one of a set of arguments (e.g A || B || C)
    - supports requiring all arguments in a set (e.g A && B && C)
    - supports inverting sets (e.g !(A && B))
    - supports requiring any or all of multiple sets (e.g (A && B) || (A && C)). This can also be negated
  - **Positional**
    - supports unix `--`, i.e `foo -- -a -b -c` will recieve positional arguments ["-a", "-b", "-c"]
    - treats all args that don't start with `-` or `--` as positional.
* **Subcommands**
  - e.g cargo run vs cargo test (run/test are subcommands)
  - subcommands can have their own subcommands and arguments
  - help/version commands are generated separately for each subcommand
* **Optional Callback support**
  - Instead of returning a results object with the argparsing results, A handler fn(Results) -> T can be provided for each command/subcommand (not supported when using serde).
* **no_std support**
  - disable default features to enable no_std
  - `parsnip = { version = "x", default-features = false }`
* **serde support**
  - `parsnip = { version = "x", features = ["derive"] }`
  - write your args schema in any format with a serde parser (serde_json, toml etc.), see derive-test for an example
* **Other opt-in features**
  - *debug* - enables logging info about arg parsing

# Usage

## Examples

## Documentation

# Development

## TODO

* Benchmarks
* More tests
* Features
** Support positional arguments
** Bash/Zsh completion
** Support disabling positional args
** Support updating repeats, e.g --arg Foo --arg Bar should give {"arg": ["Foo", "Bar"]} 
* Pretty sure my design isn't iterator friendly, try using a counter instead
